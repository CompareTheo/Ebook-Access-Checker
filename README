# Ebook access checker
A simple JRuby script to check for full-text access to e-resource titles. Plain old URL/link checking won't alert you if one of your ebook links points to a valid HTML page reading "NO ACCESS." 

This script can currently check for access problems for the following platforms/vendors: 
- Alexander Street Press 
- Ebrary 
- Sage Research Methods Online 
- SpringerLink 
- University Press (inc. Oxford) Scholarship Online

# Requirements
- You must have [JRuby] (http://jruby.org/) installed. This script has been tested on JRuby 1.7.3. Installing JRuby is super-easy; point-and-click .exe installers are available for Windows on the [JRuby homepage] (http://jruby.org/).
